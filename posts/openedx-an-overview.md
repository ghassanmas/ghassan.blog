**Last Updated:** 18 June 2022

What is Open edX, Open edX is an E-learning platform, its what powers edx.org, it was built 2012 [^1].
[^1]: May be before that, but that at least the earlist [commit](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/commit/cc1de22e2621c7fa1199750cf13ba57c937b9d98) you could go back in history with 



I have been recently involved in contributing to the Open edX project. 

In literature we have been told learning about history is important in order to understand the present and better predict the future. And I do think that also applies to a continuously evolving open source project like the Open edX. 

Add to that while I have been going over the project, to learn more a particular concept or to disambiguate an obscurity. I would mostly end up with some _historically we_...etc.


So let's go through that history. First I will go over the numbers, of the repos inside [/openedx](https://github.com/openedx) org at github, with an overview of the project in general.
Secondly I will dig into edx-platform repo in particular, in the eyes of git, using mainly `git diff` and `git log`, I do an overall summary for each year, from 2011 to 2022. 


> ==Note==: Open edX is a continuously evolving project, thus it's important when going over this overview or any simliar doc to take the last edited time into considration. Which is 19th of May 2022 in this case.


## Repos 

Code lives in repos, there are a total of 189 repos as of the time of writing. I have made a little script to visualuse how repos count increased over time.

I have also grouped/categorized some repos by  repo type, more on that later. 

As you can see from the graph the number of repos is continusesly increasing, it's important to note though that, a new repo doesn't mean a new feateur. May be it was decoupling a piece of code from the main repo edx-platform.


#### XBlocks:

Are repo dedicated to extend the functionality, of the learning experience, both in studio and LMS. With XBlock you can create a new type of problem, add new feature, e.g. let learner mark that they have complemented a unit.

XBlocks are essentially a Django based app, which can be installed to extend functionality of the platform mainly in the learning experience.

As you can conclude from the graph XBlock is may be when of the earlist feature available for the project, and though the total count is 22. There must be way more than 22 XBlocks. 22 is number of XBlock repos that are in /openedx org, i.e. they are theofficially available XBlocks.

### MFEs:

Are Repo which are based on the a modern micro frontend framework. They are  React based, with paragon as a design system.

Each MFE is responsbile for a specif user-centric UI, for example there is an MFE for the account, profile, learning and gradebook...etc. 

As you can see from graph, MFEs are relativity new, there were built in order to decouple server from UI rednerding. Without MFE  _almost_ for each UI changes the client would send a request to the server and then server render a template then respond to client. 

However with MFE instead the communication between client and server is based on JSON RESTful API. Communicating with JSON instead is way **computationally** cheaper, than responding with a rendered response. 

On other side this approach in my opinion brough two main challenge: 

- For years the community around Open edX used to change UI by customzing themes, however with this new change, an Open edX developer is required to learn React, which add a new concept. 
- The transition period: while MFEs are being adopted, this means that platform is kinda in a hyprid state. Where both server templeting and MFEs are being used and each require different workflow to customize.

While the second challenge is temproray, the first one is ongoing. 
However the community is aware of that and some work is already being devoted to solve those main issue.

### Enterpies

I don't have much knowledge around these kind of repos. My speculation seems that edx.org high class clients. the way I would put it, is that I think a consdirable amount of effort is being put into it from edx.org.

## edx-platform aka The Monolith

There are total of 60K commits, lets get other random

### An overview of Commiters: 

`git shortlog -sn --no-merges >> commiters.txt`[^2]

Lets get top 10 most commiters `head commiters.txt`
```
  2218  Calen Pennington
   922  cahrens
   901  Vik Paruchuri
   886  Brian Talbot
   854  Ned Batchelder
   805  Chris Dodge
   758  David Baumgold
   734  Diana Huang
   705  David Ormsbee
   639  Will Daly
```
[^2]: From a question on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1828874/generating-statistics-from-git-repository)  

For total number of commiters: `wc -l commiters.txt` **871**

Total commits by all `git rev-list --no-merges --count HEAD` **40659**

 I think to be more accurate and fair and get picture of the project, lets check the distribution of commits, I split the commiters into 3 sets, first commiters, who did at least 100 commits of their total commits, second who did between 10 to 100, and third who did between 1 to 10 commits.

Here are the result: 

```python
A total of 93 commiters  (whom are 10.677% of total commiters) did 29280 commits (which are 72.012% of total commits)
A total of 252 commiters (whom are 28.932% of total commiters) did 9707  commits (which are 23.874% of total commits)
A total of 528 commiters (whom are 60.620% of total commiters) did 1673  commits (which are 4.115%  of total commits)
```

![edx-platform commits distribution](/img/edx-platform-commits.png "edx-platform commits distribution")

I am not really satisfied with that, given only 10% commiters did 70% of commits.
This will tell us why the project is heavily influenced by edx.org, I bet most of commiters in top group are affiliated with edx.org. 

#### Update:

_Start of update_

When I shared this blog with the Open edX community, I recevied a note from one of long time contributor [David Ormsbee](https://github.com/ormsbee):

> But if youâ€™re treating all commits as equal and want to measure who is doing what in the code, you might want to limit the time range to after 2015 or so
> -- <cite> David Rmsbee @ https://discuss.openedx.org/t/blog-a-brief-history-of-the-open-edx/7358/2 <cite>

So following David, advice I have recreated the bar graph starting from 2016 and the result was different as he has expected.

![edx-platform commits distribution from 2016](/img/commits_from_2016.png "edx-platform commits distribution from 2016")

As you can note, in the second graph the distrubution of commits between the first two group are almost equal. This according to David has to do with the change of the  commit policy, since initally commiters didn't squash their commits. Add to that also initally edX used the main project repo for marketing site content. Which would defeinily have a larger share of commits. You could refer to the cite link above for more context.

_End of update_

But lets the see how these bars came out to be this way overtime, i.e. how did come up with that from 2012 to now. 
Recall for generating the `git shortlog -sn --no-merges >> commiters.txt`, lets repeat that but with adding a filter for date, e.g for to get all commiters by 2012:

```bash
git shortlog -sn --no-merges --until 01.01.2012 > commiters_12.txt` for 2013 `git shortlog -sn --no-merges --until 01.01.2013 > commiters_13.txt`. 
```
and so one, I did that from 2012 to 2022.

#### Change summary

Comparing **from** [#cc1de22e](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/cc1de22e) **to** [#548d0491](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/548d0491) **diff**: [2011 to 2012 ](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/compare/cc1de22e2621c7fa1199750cf13ba57c937b9d98..548d0491c3cfc8de55794243a36e86fc66aecce9).

Not much for 2011, just one contributor[^3], no thing serious so far. Also note that the date of the first commit which is aviable to public is Dec, 7, 2011. So there was not much time to do until new year holiday I guess.

I think the main work was about removing hard coded data (_hence 70% of the change are deletion_), like staff images, course content. There was even a directory called **Kirchhoff_files**!. 

 You can see for example the image of Anant Agarwal Who I think played a critical role in the development of the project. I think he was a CEO of edx.org until they were bough by U2.],Gerald Jay Sussman, and also the first.


Beside deletion main focus was authtencation, registartion. One can assume that thinking was _we want to move this from being an internal project at MIT to something general that other organization can benfit from_.


**Period Legacy**:
- It was a Django based app and still is!.
- [Xmodule](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/cc1de22e2621c7fa1199750cf13ba57c937b9d98/courseware/x_module.py)

- The project structure is split into 3 main directory, lms, cms, and common each with its djangoapps directory.
  - lms has +7 djangoapps: certificate,courseswiki,courseware django_comment_client,simple wiki,psychometrics,licenses, circuits.
  - cms has 3 djangoapps: auth,contentstore, models
  - common has 5 djangoapps: 
- Mako is being used to render template, which is still true until today. Unless it get replaced with a MFE.
- Most of the focus for frontend is being focused with MathJax
  - Makes sense because the first most famous course was about electric circuit, of which there is heavy usage of math notation. Fun note: _I almost fail that class when I was uni, may be that wouldn't have been the case if platform exist at the time_. 
- SASS styling is being used, SASS is still the main CSS framework in use even in the MFEs
- Git is being used as SVM, hence the `.gitignore` file is added
- xmodule is moved to common/lib/xmodule still holds true to today.
- The comments or the forum service was a django app.
- There was a quite huge focus on testings still holds true to today.
- edx.org was firs mentioned, stuff are being renamed from **mitx** to **edx**

#### Summary

From 2014, Open edX started to support mobile native app, some effort is dedicated into refactoring hence 26% of the changes are deleted 

More adoption to XBlock, for example the `circuit` is being removed from `lms/djangoapps/` since it can be replaced with a XBlock. 

New directory `/openedx/` is added
